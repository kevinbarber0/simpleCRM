** SIMPLE CRM **

This will be a CRM application that allows companies to view their existing customers and their data. 

Their data may include the following:

    -Customer Name
    -Customer Email
    -Customer Phone Number
    -Date Activated
    -Account Expiration Date
    
    The fields above will all be full CRUD, allowing the admin to Create, Read, Update and Delete using controllers.

    The customers account will also include a "ticket" field.
        -This should fulful the additional CRUD functionality accross the front and back end.

//// PENDING SCREENSHOT HERE ONCE I BUILD IT ///

Technologies used:

Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

- I would like the to add the ability for customers to log in and add comments to their own account details and complete a survey based on their tickets completion quality.
