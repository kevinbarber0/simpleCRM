** SIMPLE CRM **

This will be a CRM application that allows companies to view their existing customers and their data. 

For my 3 related data entries I will have Existing Customers, Active Customers, Expired Customers all will be full CRUD and will contain the following fields in my DB.

Their data  include the following:

    -Customer Name
    -Customer Email
    -Customer Phone Number
    -Date Activated
    -Account Expiration Date
    -Customer Support Tickets
    
    The fields above will all be full CRUD, allowing the admin to Create, Read, Update and Delete using controllers.

    The customers account will also include a "ticket" field.
        -This should fulful the additional CRUD functionality accross the front and back end because the Admin will be able to add or update a ticket in the customers file.

    This website will have a very simple and clean look so that Admin is not overloaded with too much unrelated data while revewiing customer records.
