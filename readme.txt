** SIMPLE CRM **

This will be a CRM application that allows companies to view their existing customers and their data. 

For my 3 related data entries I will have Services, Tickets, and Promotions.  These back end data fields will be full CRUD.

The Admin will need the ability to update a customers active services so they will have the ability to update their services from the front end or the back end.

Their data will include the following:

    -Customer Name
    -Customer Email
    -Customer Phone Number
    -Date Activated
    -Account Expiration Date
    -Amount of support tickets
    -Active services the customer is subscribed
    
    This website will have a very simple and clean look so that Admin is not overloaded with too much unrelated data while revewiing customer records.

Next Steps: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

- I would like the to add the ability for customers to log in and add comments to their own account details and complete a survey based on their tickets completion quality.
